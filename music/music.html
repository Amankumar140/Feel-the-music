                                Pop music is a genre designed to be catchy and
                                appealing, often featuring simple melodies,
                                repetitive choruses, and upbeat rhythms. It
                                focuses
                                on creating enjoyable and memorable tunes that
                                appeal to a wide audience. With its roots in the
                                1950s, pop music has evolved to include a
                                variety of
                                styles and influences, often driven by

                                and current trends. Artists like Michael
                                Jackson,
                                Madonna, and Taylor Swift have shaped its
                                development, making it a dominant force in the
                                music
                                industry. Pop music’s ability to adapt and
                                innovate
                                keeps it relevant and popular across

                                Bronx,
                                New York, and quickly became a powerful cultural
                                movement. It’s characterized by rhythmic spoken
                                lyrics, known as rapping, and is often
                                accompanied
                                by beats created through DJing and sampling.
                                Hip-hop
                                explores themes like social issues, personal
                                experiences, and community life, resonating with
                                diverse audiences. Over time, it has evolved
                                into a
                                major genre with various substyles, influencing
                                fashion, language, and entertainment. Today,
                                hip-hop
